*A fast c++ tensor library*

# FTL

FTL is a fast c++ tensor library. It is designed with both speed and clearity of expression in mind. 

The performance is achieved in numerous ways that allow ftl to perform well in multiple environments. [Expression templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates) were used to achieve the clarity of mathematical expressions.

Currently the library is CPU only and is single-threaded. Use has been made of expression templates to make the operations more intuative
